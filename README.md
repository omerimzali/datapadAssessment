## Install with Docker
- There are 2 Dockerfiles in this repository. If you're a ARM based processor user, you can use directly `Dockerfile`. If you're not, change the name and use the other one called `Dockerfile.notarm`. I didn't have a chance to try this second one but I used offical deno image in it.
-  `docker build -t denoadaptorcase .`
-  `docker run -dp 8080:8080 denadaptorcase`
# Details
This repo created for [DatapodOfficial Assesment]('https://github.com/datapadofficial/assessment-backend')

There are 4 Classes called Brand, Conversion, Customer and SpreadSheet.
SpreadSheet is doing the call, over GoogleSheets API and  It's calculating the expected metric.

A worker that periodically pulls this data and prepares the metrics (every 5 minutes) can provide a much faster response. But I did not work on this direction because I think that this does not meet the scope of the test case.

# Tests
You can run test with `deno test` command. Tests are provided

# Documents
You can get documents with `deno doc` or `deno doc --json` 

## notes
I used customer_id instead of customer name, because the data doesn't provide customer names.
I created a local file to run tests local.
I add my own GoogleSpreadSheet API.Kâ‚¬Y by own purpose. I know credentials are dangerous to be shared in a public format. I did it for you to have more easy installation steps.
